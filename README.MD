# Transavia CAO Web App

Transavia CAO Web App is an ongoing project aiming to become an extensive database for frequently asked questions about the Transavia collective labour agreement (CLA). These are questions that regularly come up within our pilot corps.

This web app is developed by [Rik Beernink (Sky-T)](https://www.sky-t.nl), the creator of projects like [vluchtjeruilen.nl](https://www.vluchtjeruilen.nl). The questions database is carefully maintained by several colleagues at Transavia.

We're always looking for colleagues with in-depth knowledge of the CLA and strong writing skills to help us in setting up and maintaining the questions database. If you have some spare time and would like to contribute, please get in touch with us via WhatsApp! We're excited to collaborate.

This web app is written in Nuxt3, Vue.js 3, Django, and Docker. If you want to help or are curious about the code, check it out!
